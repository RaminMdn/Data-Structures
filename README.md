# ðŸ“š Data Structures Practice in Python

This repository contains implementations of fundamental data structures in Python. It's created for personal learning and hands-on practice, with a focus on writing clean, testable code. Each data structure is implemented in its own file with methods, example usages, and unit testing.

---


## Typical File Content

I have tried to create for each file a consistent structure which includes:

âœ… **A class implementation** â€” defining the data structure and its core operations  
âœ… **Inline usage examples** â€” quick print-based examples to demonstrate how the structure works  
âœ… **Unit testing** â€” a `run_unit_tests()` function using Pythonâ€™s built-in `unittest` module for structured testing  


Each file includes:

- A class defining the data structure
- Methods for performing standard operations
- Simple usage examples for quick verification
- A `run_unit_tests()` function using Python's `unittest` module


## Implemented Data Structures

| Data Structure  | File             | Description                                                            |
|-----------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Linked List** | `linked_list.py` | Singly linked list with `append`, `delete`, `search`, etc.             |
| **Stack**       | `stack.py`       | Stack using list with `push`, `pop`, `peek`, `is_empty`                |
| **Queue**       | `queue.py`       | Queue using list or `deque`, with enqueue/dequeue methods              |
| **Tree**        | `tree.py`        | Binary tree with insertion, traversal, search                          |
| **Graph**       | `graph.py`       | Graph using adjacency list, with methods to add/remove nodes and edges |

### File Structure

<pre> <code>
data-structures-python/ 
  â”‚ 
  â”œâ”€â”€ linked_list.py # Singly linked list implementation
  â”œâ”€â”€ stack.py # Stack implementation 
  â”œâ”€â”€ queue.py # Queue implementation 
  â”œâ”€â”€ tree.py # Binary tree implementation 
  â”œâ”€â”€ graph.py # Graph using adjacency list 
  â”œâ”€â”€ README.md # Project documentation (this file) </code> 
</pre>

## How to Use

You can run each file directly to see basic examples and unit test output:

```bash
python linked_list.py
```

## Authorâ€™s Note

This project was developed as part of personal learning and practice.

At times, I consult pair programming tools, programming forums or relevant documentations â€” for purposes like:

- Proofreading code or comments
- Double-checking best practices
- Exploring alternative implementations

These tools were used in the same way any developer might use a second pair of eyes, and never as a substitute for understanding or authorship.

The goal was always clarity, correctness, and learning â€” with every line written and reviewed consciously and deliberately.
